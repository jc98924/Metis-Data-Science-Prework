Restore .bashrc File To Default Settings In Ubuntu

As you might already know, there is a default version of the .bashrc file in the /etc/skel/ directory in Ubuntu. So if you have problems with .bashrc file, you can easily restore it to its default settings as described below.

First, backup your current .bashrc file using command:

$ cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.bak
Then, copy the default version of .bashrc file to your current version like below:

$ cp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~/
Finally, run the following command to update the changes.

$ source ~/.bashrc
So, if you unknowingly put some crap in your .bash_profile or .bashrc files, follow the above steps to restore them to the default value. I tested this in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and worked fine. I hope It will probably work on other Ubuntu versions and derivatives.
