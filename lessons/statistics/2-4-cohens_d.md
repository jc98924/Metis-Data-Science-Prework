[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

**Exercise 2.4 Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first babies are lighter or heavier than others. Compute Cohenâ€™s d to quantify the difference between the groups. How does it compare to the difference in pregnancy length?**

>> The Cohen's d value computed for the size effect between first born children and all other children is -0.0887. This signifies that the difference in average weight is .0887 standard deviations, with first born children being relatively lighter. Based on Cohen's suggestions (listed below), the calculated value signifies a 'small' effect size for the given the dataset. Compared to the Cohen's d value for pregnancy length which is 0.0289, it does hold a slightly larger effect but both measures are considered small.

Effect size	| d	|Reference
------------|---|-----------
Very small|	0.01| Sawilowsky, 2009
Small |	0.20| Cohen, 1988
Medium | 0.50 |	Cohen, 1988
Large| 0.80 | Cohen, 1988
Very large | 1.20 |	Sawilowsky, 2009
Huge | 2.0 | Sawilowsky, 2009

    n1, n2 = len(firstborn), len(otherborn)
