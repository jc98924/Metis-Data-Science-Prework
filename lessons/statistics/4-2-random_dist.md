### [Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

**Metis:**
This questions asks you to examine the function that produces random numbers. Is it really random? A good way to test that is to examine the pmf and cdf of the list of random numbers and visualize the distribution. If you're not sure what pmf is, read more about it in Chapter 3.

**Exercise:** The numbers generated by `numpy.random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from `numpy.random.random` and plot their PMF.  What goes wrong?

Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

```
rand_1000 = np.random.random(1000)
pmf_rand = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand_1000)

thinkplot.Pmf(pmf_rand, linewidth = .1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel = 'Number (0-1)', ylabel = 'pmf')
```

As the number of distinct values in the sample size grows larger, probability mass function plots become far less useful for visualization purposes. This is exhibited in the graph above where there are so many steps to the graph that it becomes indistinguishable.

If the 'linewidth' of the plot is set to a smaller value, you can start to see the gaps in between the values but it is still not very informative.

```
thinkplot.Pmf(pmf_rand, linewidth = .10)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel = 'Number (0-1)', ylabel = 'pmf')
```

Plotting the cumulative distribution function gives a better overview in this case.

```
cdf_rand = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand_1000, label = 'rand_1000')
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf_rand)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel = 'Number (0-1)', ylabel = 'CDF')
```

Since the CDF is a fairly straight line, we can assume that the set of random numbers generated is an uniform distribution.
